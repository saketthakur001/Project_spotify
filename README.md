# SPOTIFY Manager

This is a web app that allows you to manage, recommend, and track your music on Spotify. You can create playlists, discover new songs, and see your listening statistics.

## Why I made this

I love listening to music on Spotify, but I wanted to have more features and options to enhance my experience. I wanted to be able to organize my music better, get personalized recommendations, and see how my music tastes change over time.

## How it works

This web app uses Python and Flask to connect to the Spotify API and access your music data. It then uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display the results in a user-friendly interface. You can access the web app at https://music-manager.vercel.app/.

## How to use it

To use this web app, you need to have a Spotify account and authorize this app to access your data. You also need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. You also need to install the required packages using the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Then, you can run the webapp.py file using the command `python webapp.py`. This will launch a local server that you can access at http://localhost:5000/.

Alternatively, you can deploy this web app to a hosting service like Vercel or Heroku. You will need to create an account and follow their instructions on how to deploy a Python Flask app.

## Feedback and contributions

This web app is still in production and may have some bugs or errors. I welcome any feedback or suggestions on how to improve this web app. You can contact me at saketthakur001@gmail.com or open an issue or pull request on this repository.
